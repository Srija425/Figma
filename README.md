# HTML Responsiveness Test Project

## Project Overview
This project involves converting a Figma design into an HTML webpage with strict adherence to responsiveness and design specifications. The goal is to ensure that the layout, fonts, colors, spacing, and background match precisely with the Figma design while maintaining seamless adaptation across different screen sizes.

## Deliverables
- **Responsive HTML Implementation**
  - Supports **large desktop (1920px), desktop (1440px), small desktop (1280px), and mobile (375px)** resolutions.
  - Ensures proper font, color, and spacing alignment as per the Figma design.
  - Avoids horizontal scrolling and layout gaps.
  
- **Code Structure**
  - Includes properly linked **CSS and HTML files**.
  - Ensures correct **path to CSS** and does not keep images in a separate folder.
  - Packaged as a **zip file** for easy sharing.
  
- **Hosting & Accessibility**
  - The project is hosted with a publicly accessible **hosted link**.
  - Screenshots of different views (1920px, 1440px, 1280px, 375px) are included on the hosted link.
  - Code is also shared on **GitHub** for review.

## Assumptions & Considerations
The following assumptions were made during development:
1. **Breakpoints:**
   - Devices below **1280px** are considered mobile.
   - Additional breakpoints around **780px** were added to prevent image overlap issues.
2. **Font Issues:**
   - Some bold fonts were not loading properly due to asset-related issues, so default browser fonts were used.
3. **SVG Optimization:**
   - Proposal to combine SVGs for circular icons and desktop/mobile images to optimize performance.
4. **Checkbox Effects:**
   - Additional effects for checkboxes were deprioritized for this stage.
5. **Margin & Padding Adjustments:**
   - Due to limited access to exact margin and padding values in the read-only Figma file, logical assumptions were made.
6. **Keyboard Accessibility:**
   - The "Donâ€™t remember your password" text/button is tabbable for better user navigation.
7. **Ripple Effect:**
   - The button ripple effect was excluded from the current implementation.

3. **Download the Code**: The full implementation can be accessed in a **zip file** containing HTML and CSS files.

## Next Steps
- Ensure client feedback is incorporated for any necessary refinements.
- Test thoroughly across different devices and browsers for consistent responsiveness.
- Optimize performance further if needed.
